If you are looking for a Bollywood movie that combines science fiction, action, and romance, you may want to check out Mr. X. However, be prepared to suspend your disbelief and enjoy the movie for its entertainment value rather than its realism.
  
Mr. X received mostly negative reviews from critics and audiences, who found the movie to be dull, illogical, and clichÃ©d. The movie was criticized for its weak script, poor direction, and lack of originality. The movie was also compared unfavorably to other Hollywood movies with similar themes, such as Hollow Man and The Invisible Man.
  
However, some critics and viewers praised the movie for its cast performance, especially Emraan Hashmi, who played the role of the invisible vigilante with conviction and charisma. The movie also received appreciation for its visual effects, which were done by Red Chillies VFX. The movie also had some catchy songs composed by Jeet Gannguli and Ankit Tiwari.
  
Mr. X was a commercial failure at the box office, earning only â¹ 30 crore against a budget of â¹ 37 crore. The movie was also affected by the release of Furious 7 and Avengers: Age of Ultron, which dominated the screens and the audience's attention. The movie was also banned in Pakistan due to its controversial depiction of terrorism.
  
Mr. X is not a movie that will be remembered for its quality or innovation. It is a movie that tried to cash in on the popularity of Emraan Hashmi and the genre of science fiction, but failed to deliver a satisfying or entertaining experience. It is a movie that can be easily skipped or forgotten.
  
Mr. X also has some interesting trivia associated with it. The movie is a remake of the 1957 film Mr. X in Bombay, which starred Ashok Kumar and was directed by Nanabhai Bhatt, the father of Mahesh Bhatt. The movie also features a cameo appearance by Gurmeet Choudhary and Nora Fatehi, who perform a dance number in the song "Alif Se". The movie also marks the debut of Tanmay Bhat as an actor, who is better known as a comedian and co-founder of All India Bakchod.
  
Mr. X also faced some controversies during its production and release. The movie was initially titled Invisible, but was later changed to Mr. X to avoid confusion with another film with the same name. The movie also faced legal issues when a writer named Shamoil Ahmed filed a case against the makers for plagiarism, claiming that the movie was based on his novel Soulmates: Love Without Ownership. However, the case was dismissed by the court as there was no substantial evidence to prove his claim.
  
Mr. X is a movie that tried to experiment with the genre of science fiction and invisibility, but failed to impress the critics and the audiences. The movie had some positive aspects, such as the performance of Emraan Hashmi and the visual effects, but they were not enough to save the movie from being a flop. The movie is not recommended for those who are looking for a smart and engaging thriller, but may appeal to those who are fans of Emraan Hashmi or Bollywood masala movies.
